		<p id="abt">Hey, it's Cindy, welcome to my personal site. I'm currently studying my 2A term at the University of Waterloo in Honours Computer Science. You may have heard of the place. I'm learning lots of new, exciting things every day, and loving every bit of it. For me, computer science is a way to bring my ideas to life, a way to communicate across a platform that can be universally understood. I believe that it's more art than science, because there is an immense satisfaction in going from a blank document to a fully working, completely functional program not unlike the pride an artist takes looking on their completed work. So when it comes down to it, I just want to keep doing what I love, get better at it, and hey, maybe make a difference, too.</p>
