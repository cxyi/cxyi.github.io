		<p id="abt">Hey, it's Cindy, welcome to my personal site. I'm currently studying my 2A term at the University of Waterloo in Honours Computer Science. You may have heard of the place. I'm learning lots of new, exciting things every day, and loving every bit of it. For me, computer science is a way to bring my ideas to life, a way to communicate across a platform that can be universally understood. I believe that it's more art than science, because there is an immense satisfaction in going from a blank document to a fully working, completely functional program not unlike the pride an artist takes looking on their completed work. So when it comes down to it, I just want to keep doing what I love, get better at it, and hey, maybe make a difference, too.</p>

			A project written as the internal assessment project of Higher Level Computer Science in the IB program. WriteTool was designed with the express purpose of streamlining the organizational aspect of creative writing, something that I think will be extremely useful for writers. WriteTool was coded in Java using object-oriented programming principles. </p><br>

			A sample of graphic design done in the past few years for various purposes, including advertisements, personal projects, title pages, program books, and brochures. Most of the work was done on Adobe Photoshop CS6 and GIMP 2.6. </p><br><br><br>

			In my spare time, I enjoy collaborative writing in online communities, as well as independently-written novels. I have finished two novels to date, <em>Collapse</em> (2012), and <em>Untitled</em> (2014), both of which are high-fantasy. Click the link for the first 10,000 words of each novel.</p><br></div>
